###  Intro

**JavaScript Garden** is a growing collection of documentation about the most
quirky parts of the JavaScript programming language. It gives advice to
avoid common mistakes and subtle bugs, as well as performance issues and bad
practices, that non-expert JavaScript programmers may encounter on their
endeavours into the depths of the language.

JavaScript Garden does **not** aim to teach you JavaScript. Former knowledge
of the language is strongly recommended in order to understand the topics covered
in this guide. In order to learn the basics of the language, please head over to
the excellent [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide) on the Mozilla Developer Network.
